# Ou-Séjourneront-Ils-à-Paris

A remake of my first project from my Data Analytics course with General Assembly where I had explored a dataset off Airbnb on its listings in Copenhagen using Excel. Over here I used the dataset for listings in Paris and conducted exploratory data analysis using Python instead to recreate graphs and plots I had done up previously in the Copenhagen version and added more insights garnered. The workings and plots can be found in the Jupyter notebook uploaded and project objective and findings in the PDF file.

P.S. (If you would like to look at the folium map generated, you may want to view the notebook on <a href>https://nbviewer.org/</a> instead as github is unable to display folium maps.)
