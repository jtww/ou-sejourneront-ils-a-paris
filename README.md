# Ou-Sejouront-Ils-a-Paris

A remake of my first project from my Data Analytics course with General Assembly where I had explored a dataset off Airbnb on its listings in Copenhagen using Excel. Over here I used the dataset for listings in Paris and conducted exploratory data analysis using Python instead to recreate graphs and plots I had done up previously in the Copenhagen version and added more insights garnered.
